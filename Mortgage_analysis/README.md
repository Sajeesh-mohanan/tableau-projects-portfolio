# 🏡 Mortgage Loan Analysis using Tableau

This Tableau project analyzes mortgage loan data to identify trends and risk patterns associated with loan repayment behavior. The goal is to uncover **which types of borrowers are more likely to repay loans** and which ones are more prone to **default**, based on multiple factors such as **loan type**, **interest rate**, **geographical region**, and more.

---

## 📌 Objective

To perform an in-depth analysis of mortgage loan data and derive actionable insights that can help financial institutions:
- Identify **high-risk** and **low-risk** borrowers.
- Improve **loan approval strategies**.
- Understand **demographic and geographic trends** related to loan performance.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Loan Repayment Categories**: Borrowers were categorized into **Fully Paid**, **Defaulters**, and **Current** status using a custom **calculated field**. Originally, the dataset included **7 different loan statuses**, which were grouped into 3 simplified categories for meaningful analysis.
  
- **Defaulter Profile**:
  - Higher default rates observed in certain **loan categories**.
  - Some **geographic regions** showed significantly more defaulters and should be flagged for further risk assessment.
  
- **Positive Indicators of Repayment**:
  - Borrowers with a **higher Debt-to-Income (DTI)** ratio showed **better repayment** behavior.
  - Loans with **lower interest rates** were more likely to be paid off fully.

- **Geographical Analysis**:
  - Certain regions showed a **higher number of applications**.
  - Some of these also had **concentrated default cases**, which can help target risk mitigation strategies.
